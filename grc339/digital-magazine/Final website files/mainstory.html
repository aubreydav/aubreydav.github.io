                                <h3>How to Successfully Plan a Desert Wedding</h3>
                                <p>
                                    From beach weddings to castle celebrations and restaurant parties, there are a lot of different options to consider when looking for your venue. The good news is that no matter the day-of aesthetic you crave, there’s a space for you; and if you envision a vacation vibe full of scenic photo ops and boho flair, a desert wedding might be a solution for your happily ever after.

                                <p>
                                    As you’re starting your desert wedding venue search, there are quite a few things Santalla urges couples to keep in mind. First, you’ll want to choose a venue that has plenty of gorgeous backdrop options and photo opportunities. A big part of your venue cost is going toward the picturesque and unique location, so make sure it has that desert charm you’re looking for. For example, the Hyatt Regency Indian Wells California offers two picturesque outdoor locations—The Grove and Fireside Garden—which offer panoramic views of palm trees, mountains, and stunning evening sunsets.
