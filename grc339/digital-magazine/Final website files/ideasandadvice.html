                                <h3>How to Describe Your Dream Wedding Dress Aesthetic</h3>
                            </a> 
                                <p>
                                    Getting creative with the visual aesthetic of your wedding day is one of the best ways to personalize your nuptials. And whether you've been curating your Pinterest board for years or you're new to the world of color palettes, fabrics and decor, we're here to help you narrow down your wedding style. Plenty of factors will contribute to the overall vibe of your wedding, from signage to seating and even your reception table setups—but one of the most impactful details, though, is your wedding dress. Your outfit has the power to serve as an extension of your wedding style. So, whether you've opted for a glamorous soirée at a luxe mansion or a beachy bohemian ceremony on the coast, your wedding dress aesthetic can (and should!) complement your overall vision. But how do you describe exactly what's in your head when it's time to go shopping?
                                </p>
                                  
                            
                                 
                                 <h4>
                                  Bohemian
                                  </h4> 
                                  <p>
                                  Bohemian wedding dresses are notoriously laid-back and often have a free-spirited vibe. When you think of a boho wedding dress, you might envision something with an intricate lace pattern, fringe, tassels, mismatched textures or loose skirts full of movement. Boho weddings are effortlessly cool, and the dress style follows suit. You'll want to look for simple silhouettes (think: A-line, column or sheath) that have rich textures or lacy details.
                                  </p>
                                  
                                  <h4>Classic</h4>
                                  <p>
                                  If you're looking for a wedding gown that'll never go out of style, a classic aesthetic is perfect for you. You won't find intricate beading, bold cutouts or layered textures on a classic dress. Instead, this wedding dress aesthetic is synonymous with simple shapes and fabrics (like satin, crepe, silk or taffeta). Ask your stylist to pull simple ball gowns, A-lines, trumpets or sheaths, as these silhouettes lend themselves to a timeless look.

                                  <h4>Glamorous</h4>
                                  
                                  <p>Whether you're channeling Old Hollywood or modern luxury, glam wedding dresses are perfectly fit for venues like mansions, estates, ballrooms or castles. This style often includes sparkling embellishments, like crystals or beading, as well rich, lustrous fabrics. (Think: the shinier, the better.) Glam wedding dresses can be interpreted a few ways: You might want a fitted mermaid dress with intricate hand-sewn beading, a lavish ball gown with a structured bodice and a full skirt, or a silky sheath with a statement crystal-encrusted cape. Your interpretation of a glam wedding dress may depend on where you're exchanging vows, but the key factor to know is that this wedding dress aesthetic is maximal and high-class.</p>
